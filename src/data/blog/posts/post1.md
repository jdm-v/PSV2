# Welcome to the JDDD!

Welcome to the JuanDiegoDevDiary, or JDDD for short!
I plan to use this area of my personal website to help keep track of various
development projects I'm working on. It's also a handy place for you to get
an idea of my interests as a dev outside of work!

I'm current developing:
+ Sidequest Mod for Cyberpunk2077 using CD Projekt Red's WolvenKit
+ LLM-Powered Manga/Comics Translation
+ Custom trending crypto trackers
+ Automated personal workflows
+ Personal content server
+ Custom modded gameboy
+ My personal website
